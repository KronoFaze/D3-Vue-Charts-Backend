# Internship Project Backend

During my internship at [TechTrioZ](https://techtrioz.com/techtrioz.com/index.html) my team was tasked to develop a full stack web app that displays interactive charts from any given data. I was assigned the job of developing the backend. I created a RESTful API  using Django that takes requests from the user, fetches required data from the database and then serializes the data using the Django rest framework then sends the data to the user.
